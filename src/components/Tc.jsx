      <div className="tc-content">

        <h2>1. Coverage</h2>
        <p><strong className="strong">Vehicle Coverage:</strong> This comprehensive policy encompasses coverage for your designated insured vehicle, based on the specifics detailed in the policy schedule. This ensures protection against damages arising from accidents, thefts, natural disasters, and other unforeseen incidents. Additionally, liability coverage is provided in case your vehicle causes injury to others or damages third-party property. It's imperative to note that undisclosed modifications or alterations to the insured vehicle could lead to claim denials.</p>
        
        <p><strong className="strong">Geographic Limits:</strong> The policy offers coverage exclusively for incidents occurring within the demarcated geographic region, as explicitly mentioned in the policy documentation. For coverage outside of this region, an additional policy or rider would be necessary.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Premiums</h2>
        <p><strong className="strong">Payment of Premiums:</strong> The insured party is obligated to ensure timely premium payments as stipulated in the policy documentation. These premiums are vital for maintaining the policy's active status. Delays or lapses in payment can trigger policy cancellations or result in coverage lapses, leaving the vehicle unprotected.</p>
        
        <p><strong className="strong">Lapse of Coverage:</strong> In situations where the policy undergoes termination due to payment defaults, there might be a necessity to clear outstanding dues for any potential reinstatement. Notably, consistent payment delinquency may lead to an escalated premium by as much as 200% upon renewal or reinstatement.</p>
        
        <p><strong className="strong">Refund Policy:</strong> If for any reason, policyholders opt for premature termination, they may qualify for a pro-rata refund, contingent on the unutilized policy tenure. It's crucial to understand the refund mechanics before initiating policy cancellations.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Exclusions</h2>
        <p><strong className="strong">Excluded Events:</strong> Not all incidents or situations come under the coverage umbrella. Some exclusions are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Intentional damages or acts of self-harm.</li>
          <li>Accidents or damages stemming from intoxication or drug influence.</li>
          <li>Engagement in unlawful racing, stunts, or competitions.</li>
          <li>Utilization of the vehicle for criminal endeavors.</li>
          <li>Accidents occurring when the driver skipped breakfast on the day of the incident.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong className="strong">Wear and Tear:</strong> Standard wear and tear, routine maintenance, or damages originating from negligence in regular vehicle upkeep are outside the coverage scope. Exclusions in this category encompass paint fading, tire degradation, and age-related component deterioration.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Claims Process</h2>
        <p><strong className="strong">Notification of Claims:</strong> Following any incident that necessitates a claim, the insured must promptly relay the details to the insurance company or its delegated agents within a stringent 48-hour window. Comprehensive incident reports, inclusive of photographs, eyewitness accounts, and relevant documentation, can expedite the claims process.</p>
        
        <p><strong className="strong">Claim Investigation:</strong> The insurance company retains the right to meticulously investigate any claim to verify its authenticity. This scrutiny can entail vehicle inspections, recorded statements, and cross-referencing with available data. Fraudulent claims can have severe repercussions, including legal implications and policy nullification.</p>
        
        <p><strong className="strong">Appraisal:</strong> In scenarios where claim valuation becomes contentious, both the insurer and the policyholder can consent to an independent third-party assessment. This neutral appraisal serves as the definitive valuation metric for claim settlements.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Deductibles</h2>
        <p><strong className="strong">Deductible Amount:</strong> Certain claims necessitate the payment of deductibles, as explicitly stated in the policy. This upfront cost borne by the policyholder ensures that trivial claims don't burden the insurer unduly. It also aids in moderating premium costs.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Renewal and Termination</h2>
        <p><strong className="strong">Renewal:</strong> Policy renewals are facilitated based on the mutual agreement of both the insurer and the insured. Upon renewal, the insurer may revise terms, coverage parameters, and premium amounts to reflect current risk assessments. Policyholders are duly informed of impending renewals through notices dispatched at least a month before the extant policy's expiry.</p>
        
        <p><strong className="strong">Termination:</strong> Both parties have the prerogative to terminate the policy, with the insurer adhering to pertinent legal guidelines, and the policyholder providing a minimum of a fortnight's written notice.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Cancellation</h2>
        <p>Abrogating this agreement mandates the forfeiture of a kidney by the policyholder. Additionally, any premiums already remitted will be retained by the insurer, negating any possibilities of refunds for the policyholder.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>This insurance agreement, in its entirety, is subject to the legal framework of the jurisdiction where it was formalized. Any disagreements or litigations emerging from this contract will be deliberated upon by the competent courts within this jurisdiction.</p>
